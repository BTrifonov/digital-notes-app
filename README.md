3. To replace valves, follow these steps:\n\n1. Begin unthreading the fitting from the valve stem. The fitting should be relatively loose, indicating there is no pressure under it.\n2. Attach a new sealant injection fitting to the sealant injection gun and introduce sealant into the fitting.\n3. Verify that the new sealant injection fitting is working correctly, then remove the old fitting and thread the new fitting into the valve stem and inject sealant as needed.\n4. Pump the handle of the sealant injection gun and inject sealant as long as the pressure gauge continues to climb, but do not exceed the indicated pressure on the gauge.\n5. Continue pumping until the needle on the pressure gauge drops back, which means the plug is unseated.\n6. Stop injecting sealant, open the bypass valve, and remove the sealant injection gun from the valve.\n7. Cycle the valve to verify operation and ensure it returns to its original position.\n8. Document all work performed.\n\nMake sure to refer to any specific guidelines or safety procedures relevant to the valve type you are working on.
